HoneyBadgerBFT is a leaderless and completely asynchronous BFT consensus protocols.
This makes it a good fit for blockchains deployed over wide area networks
or when adversarial conditions are expected.
HoneyBadger nodes can even stay hidden behind anonymizing relays like Tor, and
the purely-asynchronous protocol will make progress at whatever rate the
network supports.

This repository contains a Python implementation of the HoneyBadgerBFT protocol.
It is still a prototype, and is not approved for production use. It is intended
to serve as a useful reference and alternative implementations for other projects.

## Development Activities

Since its initial implementation, the project has gone through a substantial
refactoring, and is currently under active development.

At the moment, the following three milestones are being focused on:

* [Bounded Badger](https://github.com/initc3/HoneyBadgerBFT-Python/milestone/3)
* [Test Network](https://github.com/initc3/HoneyBadgerBFT-Python/milestone/2<Paste>)
* [Release 1.0](https://github.com/initc3/HoneyBadgerBFT-Python/milestone/1)

A roadmap of the project can be found in [ROADMAP.rst](./ROADMAP.rst).


### Contributing
Contributions are welcomed! To quickly get setup for development:

1. Fork the repository and clone your fork. (See the Github Guide
   [Forking Projects](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) if
   needed.)

2. Install [`Docker`](https://docs.docker.com/install/). (For Linux, see
   [Manage Docker as a non-root user](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user)
   to run `docker` without `sudo`.)

3. Install [`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

4. Run the tests (the first time will take longer as the image will be built):

   ```bash
   $ docker-compose run --rm honeybadger
   ```

   The tests should pass, and you should also see a small code coverage report
   output to the terminal.

If the above went all well, you should be setup for developing
**HoneyBadgerBFT-Python**!
